# \# Advanced Features and Security

# 

# This project implements:

# \- Custom user model

# \- Groups and custom permissions (can\_view, can\_create, can\_edit, can\_delete)

# \- Permission checks using @permission\_required in views

# 

# The `book\_list` view in `bookshelf/views.py` requires the `can\_view` permission.
